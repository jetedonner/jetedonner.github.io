# Trump on Inflation - ZDF Heute Show

## Introduction
Inflation and taxation have long been central themes in American economic debates, and Donald Trump has consistently tied the two together in his public remarks. Framing rising prices as a direct consequence of tax policies, he argues that burdensome taxation fuels economic strain for households and businesses alike. This perspective highlights his broader economic narrative: that lowering taxes is key to curbing inflation and stimulating growth.
