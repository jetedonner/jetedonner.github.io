# Quantum Computing 101

## üß† What Is Quantum Computing?
Quantum computing harnesses the principles of quantum mechanics to solve problems that classical computers struggle with. It‚Äôs at the heart of a technological revolution with wide-ranging applications.

Unlike classical bits, which are either 0 or 1, qubits can exist in multiple states simultaneously thanks to superposition. Through entanglement, qubits can be linked so that the state of one affects the other, enabling powerful parallel computations.


## üîç Key Concepts
-  Superposition: A qubit can represent both 0 and 1 at the same time.
-  Entanglement: Qubits can be interconnected, influencing each other‚Äôs states even across distances.
-  Interference: Quantum states can amplify or cancel each other out, helping optimize calculations.
-  Quantum Volume: A metric for quantum computer performance, factoring in qubit count, error rates, and connectivity.


## üõ†Ô∏è Applications
- Cryptography: Quantum computers could break traditional encryption, prompting the rise of post-quantum cryptography.
- Material Science: Simulating molecules and chemical reactions with high precision.
- Optimization: Solving complex logistics, traffic, and financial portfolio problems.
- Machine Learning: Quantum algorithms may drastically reduce training times.

## üß™ Current Developments
- Companies like IBM, Google, and Microsoft are building scalable quantum processors.
- Hybrid systems combine classical high-performance computing with quantum capabilities.
- Early use cases are emerging in pharmaceuticals, logistics, and finance.
