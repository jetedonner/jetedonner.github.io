## Synopsis
LLDBPyGUI is a longtime missed gui of mine for the opensource debugger (framework) LLDB. While LLDB comes with a comperhensive set of tools and also a C++ and Python API. It lacks of providing a useful (at least for me) GUI as it's only working as a terminal application at this day of age. So I took some time and started a GUI wrapper project that is using the Python API of LLDB and began to implement a UI with the help of PyQt6. The project is still in a really early prototype stage at the moment, but I didn't want to let you miss the idea of mine and give you a short sneak-preview of the tool I have in mind.
