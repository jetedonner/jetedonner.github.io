# The perverse LGBTQ people 😂
See the perverse LGBTQ people spoiling our little kids with your own eyes 😂. No, to be fair and straightforward, please get your own first-hand impression of what this hype is about. Negative people are saying that "Transsexuals are spoiling our little kids by educating them about sex and teaching them how to masturbate" — let it sink in a little.

## Here's my own opinion
If you simply observe and let your brain do the processing, you will most likely gain a very positive impression. You'll see that most of what the radical opponents of the so-called "Drag Queen Story Hours" are fighting with hatred and negativity and that they don’t even really know what these "Story Hours" are about or what actually happens there. They simply parrot everything that someone has fed them or that they've heard secondhand.

Dear people, please inform yourselves responsibly and engage your brains before you open your mouths and spread hate speech about minorities. That would be the very least you could do. Anything else is just ridiculous and embarrassing. That's my opinion. **Peace to all of us in this universe**

# My X-mas wish for this year for all of us
Please, in this cold and rather dark time of year, let's give everyone the love we wish and hope for, both for ourselves and for our neighbors. ... We are all/most of us in the same boat, and we are all unique and good just as we are (almost all / almost always)... Let's stand together and extend a hand to those who are less strong and oppressed, welcoming them into our ranks... That is my Christmas wish for us all and my Christmas gift to us all... **Warmest regards, Kim-David** 🌹
